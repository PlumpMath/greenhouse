0.5.0 (10/12/2010)
    - first official release

0.5.1 (10/12/2010)
    - simple packaging fix

0.5.2 (10/25/2010)
    - fixes to emulation.patched
    - fixed a bug with timeouts in the poll-based poller where it used
      seconds where the poll syscall uses milliseconds, so it was
      blocking for 1/1000th of the requested time
    - fixed a bug where coroutines blocked on pool.Pool.get or
      pool.OrderedPool.get would remain blocked indefinitely if the pool
      was close()d.
    - fixed bugs with the cleanup of IO objects (sockets, files, pipes,
      etc)
