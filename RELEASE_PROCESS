feature-freeze time
-------------------

this happens at the point close enough to the release that we will want to
start thinking about post-release features. not all of the release's features
necessarily need to be in, the main piont is that work in master *can* happen
without having to be in the release.

1. create a release-x.y.z branch off of master
2. fixes to x.y.z's features go in master as always, and are cherry-picked into
   release-.


release time
------------

this obviously happens when all of the release's tickets are complete, and all
tests pass on all supported platforms.

1. update pavement.py's "VERSION"
2. update greenhouse/__init__.py's "VERSION"
3. update RELEASE_NOTES with a summary of changes since the previous release
4. update docs/source/conf.py's "release"
5. if the major or minor version changed, update docs/source/conf.py's
   "version"
6. run paver minilib to re-generate paver-minilib.zip with the new metadata
7. commit the changes to release-
8. tag the vX.Y.Z release from the release branch and push to github. be sure
   to make it a signed tag with the gpg key in teepark-gpg-key.

9. build the docs in the release branch
10. recursive-copy docs/build/html outside of the git repo
11. checkout the gh-pages branch
12. copy the built docs into a directory vX.Y.Z
13. change the 'release' symlink to point to the new directory
14. git add, commit, and push the new directory up to github's gh-pages

15. run the sdist setuptools command and upload the new tarball to the PYPI

16. if the major or minor version changed, create a maintenance-X.Y branch from
    the release branch and push it to github
17. otherwise, merge the release- branch into the proper maintenance- branch
18. merge the release- branch into master
19. close out all fixed tickets for the release
